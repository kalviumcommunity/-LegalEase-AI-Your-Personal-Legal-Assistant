ðŸš€ Features Implemented
Prompting: Smart prompts designed to gather legal context and help generate accurate, tailored responses

Structured Output: Legal document drafts and explanations are generated in a well-structured JSON or text format for easy formatting/export

Function Calling: OpenAI's function calling is used to let the model retrieve legal definitions, draft contracts, or summarize court rulings

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): Integrates external legal databases to fetch relevant laws or case summaries to enhance response accuracy

ðŸ“¦ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js / Next.js (for UI)

Backend: Node.js + Express.js (for API calls)

AI: OpenAIâ€™s GPT APIs with Function Calling & RAG

Database: MongoDB (for storing user queries, drafts)

Deployment: Vercel (Frontend), Render (Backend)
